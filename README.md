# Library

This is a book collection web app. It collects user inputs from a form inside a modal, then creates a book object with the data the user provides, alocates them inside an empty array and displays it in the form of a card. The user can change freely the "read" status of any book from the UI and the "read data" of the object is modified

The css is build with bootstrap library
